This is a demo for NYU Tandon CS-GY 6533 Big Data Final Project.
This project focuses on creating a web application that empowers users to input specific time windows and geographical locations to obtain insights into average trip costs and strategic recommendations for drivers to maximize profitability. Our primary dataset comes from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC), and employed MongoDB to store our data. Then, we utilized JupyterLab for data visualization, analysis, and integrate with Front-end Web Development using Flask.

### Setting up the Python Environment

1. Set up a conda environment with python version=3.8
2. run  `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

### Running the app (within the conda environment)
1. run  `python app.py`
2. If the system complains that it is not able to find the Pyspark python driver, you will have to set the path to the Python binary in the environment (which can be found with the command `which python`)
